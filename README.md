Bingo for Momons! Hosted at http://bingo.scottcrossen.com

### Description

This is an expansion project inspired by the BYU course titled 'CS 201R'. In brief: It's Bingo for Mormons! Simply view the index.html on a web browser and start checking off the boxes to try and get a Bingo!

### Explanatory Note

I created this project before I learned better web design practices. As such, it's not my best work, but it does help demonstrate the creativity I had even when I was learning.
