Bingo for Momons! Hosted at http://bingo.scottcrossen.com

### Description

Once a month it is standard for members of the LDS faith to gather and have what is called a "testimony meeting". During these meetings many cliche & predictable phrases are spoken over the pulpit. This repository is for an application that combines the repetitive nature of testimony meetins with the classic game Bingo. This repository is written and maintained by Scott Leland Crossen.

This is an expansion project inspired by the BYU course titled 'CS 201R'. In brief: It's Bingo for Mormons! Simply view the index.html on a web browser and start checking off the boxes to try and get a Bingo!

### Explanatory Note

I created this project before I learned better web design practices. As such, it's not my best work, but it does help demonstrate the creativity I had even when I was learning.
